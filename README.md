Instagram web client for iPad

I recreated an existing [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flow-for-instagram/id766462439?mt=8) app for viewing Instagram photos. It's built with [Famo.us](http://famous.org/). 

It's not a fully replica of the iOS app, instead it tries to replicate most of the gestures like swiping photos etc.

**Demo**: http://klikster.info/kliksy (Note: The app works only on the iPad and needs to be added to the homescreen)

To run it locally on your machine do the following:

* Run `npm install`
* Run `bower install`

After that run `gulp` to start the server.
